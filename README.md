# AOSP+OP-TEE manifest

This repository contains scripts that can be used to build an AOSP build that
includes OP-TEE for the HiKey boards. The build is based on the latest OP-TEE
release and updated every quarter.

All official OP-TEE documentation has moved to http://optee.readthedocs.io. The
information that used to be here in this git can be found under [AOSP].
